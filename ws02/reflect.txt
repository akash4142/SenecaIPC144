1. IN MY POINT OF VIEW , IF A FLOATING POINT DATA TYPE IS CHANGED INTO THE INTEGER DATA TYPE THEN IT CAUSES SOME DATA LOSS . IT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WHEN I CONVERTED IT INTO THE INTEGER THE DIGITS AFTER THE DECIMAL GOT VANSHIED AND THE USED MEMORY IS LESS. OTHER REASON COULD BE THE THAT FLOATING POINT CONATINS NUMBER WITH 2 POWER RAISED TO 64 BUT THIS 10.12 IS NOT THAT NUMBER . SO THAT IS ANOTHER FACTOR TOO.

2. 
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
int money;
total=subtotal_Sum;
money=total/20;
total=total%20;
balance=(double)total;
printf("Twenties paper 	bills %d %lf \n",money,balance);
return 0;
}

3.method 1: 
 total=subtotal_sum*100;
loonies=total/100;
balance=total%100;
balance=(double)balance/100;
printf("Loonies %d %lf",loonies,balance);
 

method 2:
double balance;
total=subtotal*100;
loonies=total/100;
total=total%100;
balance=total;
printf("%d",total);
printf("Loonies %d %lf",loonies,balance);

method 3:
char local='a';//a=68
total=subtotal_sum*100;
loonies=total/100;
balance=total%100;
printf("Loonies %d %lf ",loonies,balance/a);
